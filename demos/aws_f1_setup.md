# Setting up the F1 Instance

## Creating an AWS account

:exclamation: A new AWS account may not have the required quota allowance to run a `f1.2xlarge` type instance. If that is the case, one should file a [quota increase request](https://aws.amazon.com/getting-started/hands-on/request-service-quota-increase/) for the `Running On-Demand F instances` service. Make sure to request a limit increase to `8 instances`, since `f1.2xlarge` contains 8 vCPUs. The quota increase may take up to a few days to process.

In your communication to AWS, please pay attention that the F1 access permissions are tied to a given region. Though we provide the demo application in this repository, the actual FPGA image is hosted by AWS. We make that image publicly available in all the F1 instance regions of today, which are `us-east-1`, `us-west-2`, `eu-west-1`, `ap-southeast-2`, `eu-central-1` and `eu-west-2`. If more regions with F1 instances appear in future, we will make the image available in those regions too. If you notice that we are late to do this, please create an issue.

## Instantiate an F1 Instance

Instantiate an `f1.2xlarge` instance with `FPGA Developer AMI`. (Please note that, the instructions below are NOT prepared for the `Amazon Linux 2` version, or the one from `Community AMI`). This AMI is not free of charge, but it is easier to work with for short-time uses of this demo. Otherwise, the XRT installation is actually more complicated than described [here](https://github.com/aws/aws-fpga/blob/master/Vitis/docs/XRT_installation_instructions.md).

## Preparation

Once the instance is initialised, login and install the dependencies:

Start with the basics:
```
sudo yum update
sudo yum upgrade
sudo yum group install "Development Tools"
```
___

Next, we will install Rust for compiling `tfhe-rs`. 

First, we should install a few dependencies.

Install `alsa`:
```
sudo yum install alsa-lib-devel
```

Install `systemd-devel`:
```
sudo yum install systemd-devel
```

This one is to install a newer version of `clang`, the default of which is lower than 3.5, and not compatible:
```
sudo yum install centos-release-scl
sudo yum install llvm-toolset-7
scl enable llvm-toolset-7 bash
```

Now, install Rust:
```
curl https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf > RUSTUP.sh
sh RUSTUP.sh -y
rm RUSTUP.sh
source "$HOME/.cargo/env"
```

The demo uses the `nightly` version of Rust, hence switch to that version:
```
rustup toolchain install nightly
rustup default nightly
```
___

For preparing the FPGA runtime, we will need the `aws-fpga` repo:
```
AWS_DIR=~/aws-fpga
git clone https://github.com/aws/aws-fpga.git $AWS_DIR
```

## Source the libraries

With the below commands, you need to make the binaries and libraries accessible for compiling the demo application.

```bash
scl enable llvm-toolset-7 bash
source /opt/xilinx/xrt/setup.sh
AWS_DIR=~/aws-fpga
source $AWS_DIR/vitis_runtime_setup.sh
```

Now, you are ready to go. You can follow the instructions on the [readme](./readme.md) file for running the demos.
