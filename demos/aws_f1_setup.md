# Setting up the F1 Instance

## Creating an AWS account

:exclamation: A new AWS account may not have the required quota allowance to run a `f1.2xlarge` type instance. If that is the case, one should file a [quota increase request](https://aws.amazon.com/getting-started/hands-on/request-service-quota-increase/) for the `Running On-Demand F instances` service. Make sure to request a limit increase to `8 instances`, since `f1.2xlarge` contains 8 vCPUs. The quota increase may take up to a few days to process.

## Instantiate an F1 Instance

Instantiate an `f1.2xlarge` instance with FPGA Developer AMI. This AMI is not free of charge, but it is easier to work with for short time uses of this demo. Otherwise, the XRT installation is actually more complicated than described [here](https://github.com/aws/aws-fpga/blob/master/Vitis/docs/XRT_installation_instructions.md)..

## Preparation

Once the instance is initialised, login and install the dependencies:

Start with the basics:
```
sudo yum update
sudo yum upgrade
sudo yum group install "Development Tools"
```
___

Next, we will install Rust for compiling `tfhe-rs`. 

First, we should install address a few dependencies.

Install `alsa`:
```
sudo yum install alsa-lib-devel
```

This one is to install a newer version of `clang`, the default of which is lower than 3.5, and not compatible:
```
sudo yum install llvm-toolset-7
```

Now, install Rust:
```
curl https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf > RUSTUP.sh
sh RUSTUP.sh -y
rm RUSTUP.sh
source "$HOME/.cargo/env"
```

The demo uses `nightly` version of Rust, hence switch to that version:
```
rustup toolchain install nightly
rustup default nightly
```
___

For preparing the FPGA runtime, we will need the `aws-fpga` repo:
```
AWS_DIR=~/aws-fpga
git clone https://github.com/aws/aws-fpga.git $AWS_DIR
```

## Source the libraries

With the below commands, you need to make the binaries and libraries accesible for compiling the demo application.

```bash
scl enable llvm-toolset-7 bash
source /opt/xilinx/xrt/setup.sh
source $AWS_DIR/vitis_runtime_setup.sh
```

Now, you are ready to go. You can follow the instructions on the [readme](./readme.md) file for running the demos.
